kernel_em_cv(

\arguments{
\item{y}{A list of length T, where each element is a matrix of observations at a given time point.}

\item{K}{Number of mixture components (clusters) in the model.}

\item{dates}{A vector of date-time objects (e.g., of class \code{POSIXct}) of length T corresponding to the time points in \code{y}.}

\item{hmu}{Bandwidth parameter for smoothing the \code{mu} (mean) estimates.}

\item{hSigma}{Bandwidth parameter for smoothing the \code{Sigma} (covariance) estimates.}

\item{hpi}{Bandwidth parameter for smoothing the \code{pi} (mixing proportions) estimates.}

\item{biomass}{A list of length T, where each element is a numeric vector of length \eqn{n_t} containing the biomass (or count) of particles for the observations at that time point.}

\item{leave_out_every}{The number of folds for cross-validation (default is 5). The \eqn{\ell}-th fold is defined as the set of time points \eqn{\{\ell, \ell + \text{leave_out_every}, \ell + 2 \times \text{leave_out_every}, \dots\}}.}

\item{scale_dates}{Logical flag indicating whether to rescale the date-time objects. If \code{TRUE}, the dates are converted to numeric values (by subtracting the minimum date and dividing by 3600) before smoothing; if \code{FALSE}, the dates are used directly.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the average log-likelihood over all cross-validation folds.
}
\description{
This function performs K-fold cross-validation (by default, 5-fold) for selecting the bandwidth parameters in a kernel-based EM model. The data is partitioned into folds by leaving out every \code{leave_out_every}-th time point, where the \eqn{\ell}-th fold is given by
\deqn{\mathcal{I}_\ell = \{\ell, \ell+ \text{leave_out_every}, \ell+2 \times \text{leave_out_every}, \dots\}.}
For each fold, the model is fit on the remaining time points using \code{kernel_em} and predictions for the left-out points are generated using \code{kernel_em_predict}. The log-likelihood of the left-out data is computed using \code{compute_log_like}, and the final cross-validation score is the average log-likelihood over all folds.
}
\details{
For each fold, the model is fit using the training data (all time points not in the current fold) and then predictions are made for the left-out time points. The log-likelihood for each fold is computed by summing the log-likelihoods over all observations and then averaging over the time points in the fold. The overall cross-validation score is obtained by averaging the log-likelihoods over all folds.
